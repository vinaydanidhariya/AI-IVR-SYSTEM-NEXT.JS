AI IVR SYSTEM 



An AI IVR (Interactive Voice Response) System automates customer interactions using AI-driven speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP). It intelligently routes calls, provides self-service options, and improves user experience by understanding and responding to voice inputs. Your system likely integrates machine learning models for intent detection, sentiment analysis, and adaptive responses, ensuring efficient call handling and reducing human intervention. 🚀
